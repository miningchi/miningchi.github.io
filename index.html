<h3><a href="https://miningchi2.shinyapps.io/chicrime/">Chicago Crime Data Visualization</a></h3>
<p>This site allows you to visualize and analyze Chicago's crime statistics. You can look at the information on crimes, visualize it on a map, see descriptive statistics about crime, examine how crime is correlated, and even see the relationship between weather and crime.</p>

<h3><a href="http://eyeingchicago.com/red-light-camera-study/">Red Light Camera Study (c. 2010)</a></h3>
<p>This report conducted an analysis on the effectiveness of red light camera using data obtained from the city of Chicago and the Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT).  We found accidents in Chicago fell between 2001 and 2008. In contrast, accidents at intersections with RLCs in our study actually increased. This result throws doubt on the cityâ€™s claims of significant accident reductions because of RLCs.  Additionally, the data also shows that the share of accidents at traffic signals has stayed roughly constant. This suggests red light cameras are not reducing accidents throughout the city.</p>
