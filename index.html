<h3><a href="http://miningchi.github.io/tsne.html">Word2Vec Clustering
of Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals</a></h3>
<p>This page presents a clustering example of 40,000 cases from the
Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals. It uses Word2Vec with Kmeans for the
clustering analysis. The results
are then presented using Bokeh. The code is available as an iPython
notebook on <a href="https://github.com/rajshah4/7thCircuit">my Github
repo.</a></p>
<h3><a href="http://cdb.io/1zZtEVh">Accident Heat Map for Chicago</a></h3>
<p>This page is an accident heat map for Chicago. The map is colored by
the crash rate for a street. The streets in red are the more dangerous
streets, while green has a reduced crash rate. You can see the crash
rate for a given segment by hovering on a street. The crash rate takes
into account the traffic volume for a street.</p>
<h3><a href="https://miningchi2.shinyapps.io/redlight/">Accident
Analysis for Chicago</a></h3>
<p>This site allows you to analyze accidents in Chicago, with an
emphasis on Chicago's red light cameras. The site provides accident
data for any address in Chicago or accidents that occurred within a 100
feet of a red light camera between 2009 to 2012. The site also provides
statistics on red light camera tickets for each intersection.
Information is presented in tables, plots, and a map.</p>
<h3><a href="https://miningchi2.shinyapps.io/chicrime/">Chicago Crime
Data Visualization</a></h3>
<p>This site allows you to visualize and analyze Chicago's crime
statistics. You can look at the information on crimes, visualize it on
a map, heat maps, descriptive statistics, trend analysis, and even see
the relationship between weather and crime.</p>
<h3><a href="http://eyeingchicago.com/red-light-camera-study/">Red
Light Camera Study-2014</a></h3>
<p>Chicago leads the nation with over 380 red light cameras (RLCs) at
190 intersections. Four years ago, a short study threw doubt on the
city’s claims of significant accident reductions because of red light
cameras. This page contains the follow-up study that looks at accident
data and ticket data between 2009 and 2012. It finds there is no
evidence of a significant safety benefit from the red light cameras.</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.rajivshah.com/ShahChicagoCameras.pdf">Effectiveness
of the Chicago Camera Network on Crime</a></h3>
<p>This paper found the initial crime level of an area where a camera
was placed had a significant effect. In areas with high crime, cameras
were very effective in reducing crime. In other areas, the cameras had
little effect in reducing crime. This exploratory research suggests
fewer cameras in crime hotspots are much more effective than a wide
diffuse camera dragnet.</p>
<h3><a href="http://eyeingchicago.com/blog/2010/8/1/effectiveness-of-red-light-cameras-in-chicago-an-exploratory.html">Red
Light Camera Study-2010</a></h3>
<p>This report conducted an analysis on the effectiveness of red light
camera using data obtained from the city of Chicago and the Illinois
Department of Transportation (IDOT). We found accidents in Chicago fell
between 2001 and 2008. In contrast, accidents at intersections with
RLCs in our study actually increased. This result throws doubt on the
city’s claims of significant accident reductions because of RLCs.
Additionally, the data also shows that the share of accidents at
traffic signals has stayed roughly constant. This suggests red light
cameras are not reducing accidents throughout the city.</p>
